_cluster_bipartite_hierarchical.py_ performs the hierarchical clustering.

_make_geographicboundsplot.py_ creates a file from the hierarchical clustering, which contains only the edges of the clusters that are created at every iteration.

_plot_hierarchy_clusters_ANOSIM.py_ plots figure 2 of the manuscript.

The *Distance_matrix* folder contains the code which is used to obtain files with the ANOSIM test results.
